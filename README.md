# NIM GAME

Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (i.e., nimming) objects (sticks) from distinct heaps or piles. 

## Rules
1. On each turn, a player must remove minimum of one stick and maximum of 3 sticks from the heap.
2. The player who takes the last stick from the heap loses the game.

## Code design

The NIM game is coded for different player strategies. The `nim_human1` and the `nim_human2` is coded for a game play between two human players. The `nim_minimal`, `nim_best` and `nim_computer` is coded for auto play with different strategies. Start the game by entering the heap size followed by selecting the 2 players.
